# about me
This... is my story. 27/M/Learning anything and everything, especially tech. Snowboarding is awesome.
CSULB grad.
Got something big in the works that will have definite potential for use -> customer service management.
What I'm tinkering with at the moment: setting up home voip system (waiting on some equipment and should be up by the weekend).
That's all for now.
